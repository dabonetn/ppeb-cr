## Project Overview

[**PPEB-cr**](https://github.com/dabonetn/ppeb-cr) is a fully integrated, all-in-one expansion solution for the TI-99/4A home computer.  
Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico W, it recreates multiple expansion cards and peripherals inside one modern sideport device:

- Speech Synthesizer (PWM Emulated)
- 32K RAM Expansion
- SAMS Memory (2MB/8MB PSRAM)
- Myarc RAM (512K)
- Cartridge GROM/GRAM loader
- Disk Controller with .DSK sector image support
- IDE Hard Disk Emulation via USB stick
- RS232 Serial Support (3.3V or TCP/IP socket)
- TIPI Extensions Compatibility
- USB Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Bluetooth HID support
- Math Co-Processor for accelerated floating-point math
- Digi-Port 8-bit audio output support

The PPEB-cr project is built on the firmware by **JasonACT** with hardware modifications by **dabone**, community contributions via AtariAge, and extensive testing by numerous TI-99 enthusiasts.

This documentation provides a **turnkey build guide**, full feature reference, wiring diagrams, SD card prep instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting information ‚Äî designed for both builders and end-users.

## Safety Warnings

> **IMPORTANT ‚Äî READ BEFORE USING OR BUILDING:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never power the PPEB-cr through USB while it is connected to your TI-99/4A.**  
  The device draws power directly from the TI sideport. USB power while inserted can cause hardware damage.
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Always power down the TI-99/4A before inserting or removing the PPEB-cr.**  
  Repeated insertion/removal while powered on can damage TI-99 side port buffer chips.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **The QI (Quality Improved) model of the TI-99/4A is not supported without hardware modifications.**  
  This is a TI motherboard limitation: QI units block GROM access on the side port, which is required for cartridge emulation.

---

## Special Build Notes


- üõ† **RS232 Support:**  
  RS232 is provided via the Pico W's second UART at 3.3V logic levels.  
  Not compatible with 8MB memory for Sams.
  If you require RS232 output, connect:
  - `GP8 ‚Üí TX`
  - `GP9 ‚Üí RX`

- üõ† **Power Supply Stability:**  
  TI-99/4A power supply health is critical to PPEB-cr stability.  
  Many random lockups have been traced to marginal regulators or aged power bricks.  
  If experiencing intermittent behavior, verify or recap your TI power supply.

- üõ† **C4 Capacitor Removal:**  
  On the first relase of the SMD based boards, **C4 must be removed** for SD card compatibility.

## üîß Build Procedure


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Pico W Installation**

- Pico W module solders to the board using the castellated edges on the Pico.
- Verify correct alignment:
  - USB port facing rear of case
  - Pin 1 correctly oriented
  - Apply soldering iron to the pcb and the edge of the pico, and apply solder.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sideport Edge Connector**

- Bend the pins on the edge connector in, using a flat surface like a table, they should look like a /\ with just enough room for the board to squeeze between the pins. (Tight is ok)
- Slide the board into the 44-pin sideport edge connector carefully.
- Check for bent pins, and try to align the board and edge connector in a straight line.
- Solder the two opposite end pins on one side, then check to make sure the connector is straight with the board, then solder the other side. Then solder all the other connections on the connector.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reset Button (Optional)**

- Mount reset button on the PCB header.
- Cut the 2 pins close to the edge of the board flush before soldering.
- Solder the connectors.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Rear USB Port (Optional)**

- Install USB Connector
  - Solder the 4 usb pins and the 2 support pins.
  - Solder points tp2 and tp3 from the underside of the board to the underside of the pi pico. (This makes the actual USB connection to the rear)

--- 

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Program the PICO**

- Before installing into the case, be sure to program the Pi Pico W. (See firmware instructions below)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **RS232 Breakout (Optional)**

- If RS232 functionality is desired:
  - Wire `GP8 ‚Üí TX` and `GP9 ‚Üí RX` to external header.
  - Voltage is 3.3V logic-level ‚Äî external level shifter required if interfacing to legacy DB9 serial hardware.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Case Assembly**

- Print STL files:
  - `PPEBcr-CaseBottom.stl`
  - This is used for either top.
  - `PPEBcr-Button.stl`
  - This is a very small print.. On a fast printer, either print a bunch, or find the slicer setting to set a min time per layer for good results.
  
  - Case Tops
  
  - `PPEBcr-CaseTop-M3-Nuts.stl`
  - This uses m3 nuts forced into the print. Can work, but be careful when you tighten your screws as they will remove the nuts.
  - `PPEBcr-CaseTop-HeatSetInserts.stl`
  - This uses m3 inserts.
  
- Use M3x8 or M3x10 screws to secure PCB inside case for the insert case, for the M3 Nut version, it depends on how far down you put yours nuts.
- Place the PCB into the lower case. There is a U shaped cutout in the board to help align.
- Place the button in the hole, and then place to two case halves together and secure with the screws.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Inspection**

- Verify:
  - All solder joints are clean.
  - No solder bridges between pins.
  - SD card socket functional.
  - Case fits without stress on PCB.
- DO NOT power device until all checks complete.

---

# Firmware Installation

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB-cr uses custom firmware built for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, created by JasonACT and the AtariAge development community.

The firmware package includes:

- Main firmware UF2 image
- ROM packs
- DSR files
- Support files for SD card structure

You only need to flash the UF2 file once to load the firmware onto the Pico W.  
Future updates may simply involve replacing files on the MicroSD card.

---

## üóÉ Firmware Package Contents

From the `PPEB2.zip` package with the UF2 firmware file you received, you should have:

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `PPEB.uf2` | Main firmware binary (can be named something else, but will have .uf2 at the end |
| `/CART/` | Cartridge ROM files |
| `/DSK/` | Disk image examples |
| `PCode.ROM` / `PCode.GRM` | PCode card support |
| `autoload.cfg` | Sample configuration file |
| `BLNK.DSK` | Blank RAM disk image |
| `README.txt` | Original developer notes |

---

## üñ• Flashing Procedure

> **‚ö† NOTE:** The Pico W must be flashed BEFORE inserting it into the TI-99/4A system!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Pico W

- Do not have a Microsd card inserted.
- Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button on your Pico W.
- While holding the button, connect the Pico to your PC using a microUSB cable.
- The Pico should appear as a USB mass storage device named **RPI-RP2**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Flash UF2 Firmware

- Copy the file `PPEB.uf2` directly onto the Pico‚Äôs USB drive.  These files are only [located on AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/28/#findComment-5639111).
- After the file copies, the Pico will automatically reboot into PPEB-cr mode.
- It should blink 3 times when powered with no microsd inserted.
- It should blink once when powered n with a microsd card with the correct files is inserted.

> ‚úÖ Firmware is now installed and ready for use.

---

## üîÑ Future Firmware Updates

- To update firmware:
  - Repeat this same UF2 flashing procedure.
  - No special erasure or prep needed.
- Updating firmware will not affect SD card contents or existing configuration.

---

## üõë Important Reminder

- NEVER power the Pico via USB when installed in the TI-99/4A sideport.
- All power should come from the TI sideport itself.

---

> ‚úÖ Firmware installed. Proceed to [SD Card Preparation ‚Üí](#sd-card-preparation)

---
# SD Card Preparation

---

## üìã Overview

The MicroSD card is absolutely essential to PPEB-cr operation.  
The device will not function properly without a properly prepared SD card inserted.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE:

- exFAT format
- GPT partition tables
- Cards with manufacturer "quick formats"
- SDXC cards larger than 32GB (unless specially pre-formatted for FAT32)

---

## üßπ Clean Formatting (Highly Recommended)

### Windows (`diskpart` method)

1. Open **Command Prompt** (as Administrator)
2. Type:
    ```
    diskpart
    list disk
    select disk # (your SD card number)
    clean
    create partition primary
    format fs=fat32 quick
    assign
    exit
    ```

### macOS/Linux

- Use **Disk Utility** or `gparted`:
  - Partition table: MBR (Master Boot Record)
  - Format: MS-DOS FAT32

---

## üìÇ SD Card File Structure

Your SD card root should contain the following folders and files.  They can be obtained from the AtariAge comment that is [current as of the writing of this document](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/358129-pi-picow-peripheral-expansion-box-side-port-device/page/28/#findComment-5639111).

# IDE and USB Storage Setup

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB-cr supports IDE hard disk emulation through the use of USB storage devices.  
Unlike floppy disk image support (which uses the MicroSD), IDE emulation works **only via USB**.

The IDE emulation replicates Myarc-style hard disk functionality for compatible TI disk managers and OS environments.

---

## üñß Hardware Notes

- IDE images must be stored on a USB memory stick attached to the PPEB-cr.
- The Pico W enumerates the USB drive automatically on startup.
- You may use a powered USB hub to allow multiple USB devices simultaneously (keyboard, mouse, joystick, USB drive).

---

## üìÇ File Structure on USB

The USB stick root directory should contain:

```bash
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ harddisk1.dat      <-- IDE drive 1 image
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ harddisk2.dat      <-- IDE drive 2 image (optional)
```

- Image files are raw sector dumps, not filesystem dumps.
- File sizes up to ~2GB per image supported.
- Images may contain multiple partitions, formatted using Myarc HD utilities.

---

## üîß Enabling IDE in `autoload.cfg`

Example configuration:

```ini
IDE=1
HARDDISK1=harddisk1.dat
HARDDISK2=harddisk2.dat
```

- `IDE=1` activates IDE functionality.
- Filenames must match exactly (case-sensitive).

---

## üß∞ IDE Image Preparation

- IDE images may be created via:

  - Myarc utilities (real hardware or emulator)
  - MAME or Classic99 IDE tools
  - Raw image creation utilities (Linux `dd` or Windows disk image tools)

- Images may contain one or more TI partitions depending on tool used.

- It is strongly recommended to build IDE images on emulator or PC before transferring to USB.

---

## ‚ö† Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| IDE not detected | USB drive not seen | Try different hub port |

# Appendix B ‚Äî Memory Tester Usage

---

## üìã Overview

The PPEB-cr uses external PSRAM modules to enable SAMS and advanced memory features.

Because PSRAM chips can vary significantly in timing tolerance, JasonACT developed a standalone memory test utility to validate stable operation at specific Pico clock speeds.

---

## üíæ Tool Provided

- File: `memtest2.uf2`
- Delivered as: `memtest2.ino.uf2.zip` (extract before use)

This is a standalone firmware image that runs on the Pico W outside of PPEB-cr firmware.

---

## üñ• Flashing Procedure

1. Disconnect Pico W from PPEB-cr board (or flash prior to full assembly).
2. Connect Pico W to PC via microUSB while holding **BOOTSEL** button.
3. Copy `memtest2.uf2` to the Pico W mass storage device (`RPI-RP2`).
4. Pico will reboot into the memory tester.

> ‚ö† This test runs *without* the TI-99/4A attached.

---

## üß™ Test Behavior

- The Pico W will attempt repeated full PSRAM memory tests.
- If an error occurs, onboard LED will flash blink codes indicating failure.

| LED Blink Pattern | Meaning |
|--------------------|---------|
| Constant solid | Test running, no errors |
| Flashing pattern | Memory failure detected |

- Each failure pattern identifies which test stage failed.

- The test runs continuously to catch intermittent errors caused by marginal chips or thermal changes.

---

## üîß Adjusting Pico Timing

If memory errors are detected, you may tune firmware timing via `autoload.cfg`:

```ini
MHZ=258
NOPS=5
NOPSW=5
```

- Lower `MHZ` values slow Pico clock speed for stability.
- `NOPS` and `NOPSW` introduce deliberate read/write delays.
- Use the memory test tool after adjustments to confirm stability before flashing final PPEB-cr firmware.

---

## üìù Test Recommendations

- Run for several minutes to verify no errors under thermal load.
- Perform test after full PCB assembly to account for solder joint quality.
- Use known-good name-brand PSRAM chips whenever possible.
